		<li>Data from A high resolution map of the Arabidopsis thaliana developmental transcriptome based on RNA-seq profiling: Klepikova et al., 2016, Plant J. 88:1058-1070.</li>
		<li>Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Plant Kit and Illumina cDNA libraries were generated using the respective manufacturer's protocols. cDNA was then sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 with a 50bp read length. The read data are publicly available in NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive under the BioProject ID 314076 (accession: PRJNA314076).</li>
		<li>Reads were aligned to the reference TAIR10 genome (Lamesch et al., 2012) using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009).</li>
		<li>Reads per gene were counted with an in-house Python script using functions from the HTSeq package (Anders et al., 2015).</li>
		<li>RPKM values were compiled using an in-house R script.</li>
